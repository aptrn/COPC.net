I'm making a C# real-time application for which i need to use COPC.
In order to use it in my codebase i need a library to use laszip and the COPC standard.
I already found the laszip implementation in c# on github so that side should be covered.
The issue is that i didn't find a c# implementation of the COPC standard implementation, just found C++ and Typescript implementations.

I would like you to look at the definitions of those library, along with the laszip c# implementation and try to port the COPC library to C sharp.
You can find all the mentioned libraries in the repos folder.
